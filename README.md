A program that makes copy/pasting a bit smarter.

Usage:
- Copy something like you normally do (Ctrl+C). In fact. Copy a bunch of things
- Now you can use Ctrl+V to paste the last thing you copied, but if you'd like to browse your history, simply press Ctrl+Shift+V
- Now a list of the last copied items should pop up and you'll be able to paste what you select
